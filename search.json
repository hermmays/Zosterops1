    "section": "",
    "text": "This study is part of a decades-long international collaboration to learn about the systematics, evolution, and island biogeography of East Asian and Philippine birds. This chapter in that story involves the systematics of a particularly complex group within the white-eye genus Zosterops. The systematics of the white-eyes of East Asia and the Philippines, dubbed the Asiatic white-eyes, has proven to be confounding. Various studies have made strides in understanding this group but have suffered from insufficient sampling to tackle this particular problem (Lim et al. 2018; JONES and KENNEDY 2008; Gwee et al. 2020; Oliveros, Andersen, and Moyle 2021; Moyle et al. 2009). With the help of collaborators at the University of Kansas we produced a RADseq dataset and coupled that genome-wide genetic data with a smaller allele-based Sanger sequenced dataset and phenotypic data from linear morphometrics from museum study skins. Here we will describe in detail, perhaps excruciating, the methods and analyses in this work. The hope is that the work will be reproducible by our colleagues and accessible for students, especially for those learning to grapple with the complexities of large-scale single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) datasets."

    "text": "Lab work and analysis\nAll the bench work for this project was conducted either at the University of Kansas for RADseq or Marshall University and Cincinnati Museum Center for the Sanger sequenced loci. Initial analyses were done at the University of Kansas by Devon DeRaad and published in the journal Biological Invasions (DeRaad et al. 2024). Where those initial analyses focused on using the RADseq data and ecological niche modeling to study the origin and spread of the introduced populations in Hawaii and Southern California, this study takes those data and adds Sanger sequences and morphology to focus on the systematics of the group in Asia. The initial basic filtering and preparation of the RADseq data for analysis is documented in (DeRaad et al. 2024). All the analyses here are directed toward solving the puzzle of the species limits within this group and determining their relationships. The lead on those integrative analyses were done by Herman Mays Jr. at Marshall University with considerable help from Laura Kubatko at Ohio State University.\n\n\n\nA view of lab work in the lab of one of the authors (HLM) at Marshall University."

This analysis was conducted on a prior version of BEAST2 (v2.7.4 available here) but nearly identical results were achieved using the most recent version of BEAST2 (v2.7.7 as of the writing of this protocol). BEAUTi2 is the tool available with BEAST2 that allows for package management and a graphical user interface (GUI) to generate the xml files needed to run analyses. The programs LogCombiner and TreeAnnotator are also included with the BEAST2 install and will be needed to process the results of the MCMC runs. In addition, the program Tracer will be required to assess the results of an MCMC run and FigTree to edit and visualize species trees produced by BEAST2. Below is a summary of the needed software for this analysis and links to downloads.\n\nBEAST2 v2.7.4 (R. Bouckaert et al. 2019) This install will include BEAST2, BEAUTi2, LogCombiner, and TreeAnnotator.\nTracer (Rambaut et al. 2018)\nFigTree\n\nIn addition the following packages will need to be installed from the BEAUTi2 GUI using the package manager. To install packages in BEAUTi2 select File from the top bar and Manage Packages from the drop down menu. The package manager will display a table of installed packages and their latest versions. To install select the desired package and click on the Install/Upgrade button. After installing or upgrading packages you will have to close BEAUTi2 and restart before proceeding.

    "text": "Generating the xml file\nAfter installing the needed packages restart BEAUTi2. From the File menu select Template and then StarBeast2. The StarBEAST2 template should display nine tabs titled as follows; Partitions, Taxon Sets, Tip Dates, Gene Ploidy, Population Model, Site Model, Clock Model, Priors, and MCMC.\n\nPartitions\nSequence alignments will be added to the xml file in the Partitions tab. This can be done by either clicking the + button at the bottom of the tab and selecting Import Alignment from the subsequent menu options or by simply dragging the fasta file for each alignment into the Partitions tab. After specifying that an alignment is being imported select nucleotide when asked by BEAUTi2 to “Choose the datatype”. For each locus the correct number of taxa, sites, and data type should be listed. For each the file name will be used as the name BEAST2 uses for that particular locus. Also each locus should have a Site Model, Clock Model, and Tree unique to that alignment and with the same name. The Partition tab should look like this when completed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaxon sets\nFor the mtDNA alignments each individual sample has only a single sequence while there are two sequences for the diploid nuDNA alignments. The two phased sequences for each diploid individual sample should be labeled a and b (i.e. ZJja004a and ZJja004b are the two phased sequences for sample ZJja004). The a and b suffixes were automatically added to sample names for the phased sequences in PHASE 2.1.1 (see Sanger sequencing summary statistics and trees). For consistency an a suffix was manually added to the sample name for each sequence in the mtDNA alignments to prevent a third sample name from appearing for each sample with both mtDNA and nuDNA sequences in the Taxon sets tab.\nSome project numbers do not necessarily reflect the taxonomic origin of the individual samples. For example, samples ZJlo001 - ZJlo005 appear based on their project number designations to be Zosterops japonicus loochoensis but these project numbers were assigned in error before realizing they originated on the island of Chichijima outside the range of Z. japonicus loochoensis. For the Ogasawara Islands the subspecies designation for Z. japonicus is uncertain with some suspicion that these birds are subspecies hybrids between Z. japonicus stejnegeri in the Izu Islands and Z. japonicus alani in the Ogasawara/Volcano Islands. For our purposes we assigned birds in the Ogasawara and Volcano Islands the taxonomic designation Z. japonicus alani and birds in the Izu Islands Z. japonicus stejnegeri with the realization that gene flow may be occurring throughout these oceanic islands.\nClick the Taxon sets tab. A list of sample names corresponding to the sequences in the alignments should appear in the Taxon column. For each sample a designation could be manually entered into the Species/Population column (time consuming) or automatically filled from a taxon sets file. To automatically add information on taxon assignment and/or population of origin click the Guess button at the bottom of the tab. Another window will open. Select the radio button corresponding to the read from file and the corresponding Browse button to select the appropriate taxon sets file. Click the Show options button and select txt to allow for the selection of txt files as taxon set entries. For the first set of BEAST2 runs samples were grouped by taxon (species and subspecies) and geography (island or island group) according to the Zosterops taxon sets A.txt file.

SINGAPORE\nDifferent sets of StarBEAST2 runs will employ different xml files each with a different taxon set. Below is what the Taxon sets tab should look like with Zosterops taxon sets A.txt. The first run will be with this taxon set specifying both taxon and geographic localities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip dates\nThe next tab in BEAUTi2 is the Tip Dates tab. The only selection in this tab is a check box associated with Use tip dates. Leave this box unchecked and proceed to the next tab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGene ploidy\nThe ploidy for each locus is set on the next tab titled, appropriately, Gene Ploidy. A list of loci corresponding to those alignments imported into the Partitions tab should appear in the Gene Ploidy tab. Enter the ploidy for each locus in the corresponding box. nuDNA loci are diploid and biparentally inherited so for those loci enter a ploidy of 2.0. The mtDNA loci are uniparentally inherited and haploid. For the mtDNA loci enter 0.5 in the ploidy box. When completed this tab should appear as follows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopulation Model\nIn the Population Model tab select Analytical Population Size integration from the drop-down menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite Model\nSubstitution models for each unlinked locus are set in the Site Model tab. For each locus use bModelTest to estimate the best substitution model. If the bModelTest package (see Software and Packages section above) was installed then this option should be available in BEAUTi2 in the drop-down at the top of the Site Model tab as the BEAST Model Test option. For each locus select BEAST Model Test from the drop-down and for Mutation Rate click the estimate box. Mutation rates among loci are estimated relative to one another so leave the Mutation Rate at 1.0 for each locus. Repeat this process for each locus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClock Model\nNext set the molecular clock model. Click on the Clock Model tab. For each locus added to the Partition tab there should be a corresponding entry listed in the Clock Model tab. For all loci select Strict Clock from the drop-down menu at the top of the tab. The substitution rate for mtDNA was based on a divergence rate of 2.1% per million years (Ma). This equates to a mean of 1.05% or 0.0105 substitutions/site/lineage/Ma. This range is consistent with mtDNA substitution rates reported in birds (FLEISCHER, MCINTOSH, and TARR 1998; Pereira and Baker 2006; WEIR and SCHLUTER 2008; Eo and DeWoody 2010). For both the mtDNA loci (COI and ND2) enter 0.0105 in the Clock.rate box and click the estimate box. For the nuDNA loci enter 0.00105 in the Clock.rate boxes and check the estimate box.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPriors\nStarBEAST2 is a Bayesian method and as such it requires the user to set the priors for various parameters. For these analyses the default priors will be used for everything except for the clock rates. As we did for the Clock Model tab, clock rate priors will be based off of molecular clock rates estimated in the literature. Click on the Priors tab and scroll down to the strictClockRate values for each locus. Select the arrow symbol on the left to reveal the settings for the strictClockRate prior distribution for each locus. A LogNormal distribution from the drop down menu should be selected for all the strictClockRate priors. The box to the right should have the initial clock rate for each locus (same as defined in the Clock Rate tab) and show lower and upper bounds from 0.0 to infinity. Consistent with mtDNA substitution rates reported in birds (FLEISCHER, MCINTOSH, and TARR 1998; Pereira and Baker 2006; WEIR and SCHLUTER 2008; Eo and DeWoody 2010) the mean clock rate (M) for the mtDNA loci (COI and ND2) will be set at 0.0105 substitutions/site/lineage/Ma with a standard deviation (S) of 1.0. Make sure the Mean in Real Space box is checked to view the prior distribution. For the mtDNA loci M = 0.0105 and S = 1.0 and a log normal distribution results in a 5 - 95% quantile range of 0.00123 - 0.033 and a median clock rate of 0.00637. The same conditions should be set for each nuDNA locus prior except that the mean (M) should be set at 1/10th the clock rate of the mtDNA loci (M = 0.00105). For the nuDNA loci the 5 - 95% quantile range is 0.000123 - 0.0033 and the median clock rate is 0.000637.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMCMC\nThe final tab (MCMC) sets the parameters for the run. Enter 10 million (10000000) in the Chain Length box. Enter 20000 in the box titled Store Every to indicate that results should be stored every 20,000 iteration of the MCMC chain. The burnin period should be 1 million. Enter 1000000 into the corresponding Pre Burnin box. The number of initiation attempts should be 10 (enter 10 for the Num Initiation Attempts box). Leave the remaining parameters at their default values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave xml file\nAll the needed parameters for the xml file are now completed. Save the file by selecting File from the top bar in BEAUTi2 and Save as.\nReplicate multiple independent runs in three groups. Group A uses the Zosterops taxon sets A.txt file in the xml setup with both taxon and island information to define the individual samples. Group B also uses both taxon and island information in the BEAUTi2 Taxon sets tab during the xml setup but employs the Zosterops taxon sets mtDNA.txt file to define the individual samples. Group A xml files include all loci in the Partitions tab. Group B xml files include only the two mtDNA loci (COI and ND2) in the Partitions tab. Group C runs include all loci in the Partitions tab but use the Zosterops taxon sets B.txt file to define the samples by taxon only, collapsing populations across multiple localities into the same taxonomic group.\nCreate a working directory for each run labeled appropriately (A1-20; B1-20; C1-20). Create one xml file for each of these groups and duplicate that file 20 times changing the file name to create a sequential series of xml files from 1 -20 (A1-A20 for Group A, B1-B20 for Group B, and C1-C20 for group C).\nNames for xml files for the first runs in each group are as follows. ‘STARBEAST274’ denotes the version of StarBEAST2 used and BMT denotes that these runs use bModelTest for the site model selection.\nZosterops_STARBEAST274BMT_A1.xml\nZosterops_STARBEAST274BMT_B1.xml\nZosterops_STARBEAST274BMT_C1.xml"

    "text": "Data files\nThis dataset includes Sanger sequenced polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplicon alignments for two mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and six protein coding nuclear loci (nuDNA). Prior to this analysis Sanger sequencing ab1 files were uploaded to GeneiousⓇ 8.1.9 for editing, alignment, and quality control. Multiple sequencing runs for each amplicon were assembled and assembled loci were aligned across individual samples using Geneious Alignment. Alignments for each locus were trimmed and edited in Geneious and the identity of each locus confirmed with a megablast search. The reading frame was set by eye by avoiding frames with stop codons and a blastp search was done on the translation consensus for each alignment to confirm the locus identity. Alignments were exported as fasta files.\nAlignments of diploid cdDNA loci were phased using PHASE 2.1.1 (Stephens, Smith, and Donnelly 2001). First, convert the alignment fasta files from Geneious to the inp format for PHASE 2.1.1 using the online SeqPHASE tool (Flot 2009). At the ‘Genotypes to be phased’ prompt click the ‘Browse’ button and select the appropriate fasta alignment. Click the ‘Run SeqPHASE’ button. Once step 1 of the SeqPHASE process is completed retain the seqphase.const file in addition to the seqphase.inp file and rename each file appropriately to match the locus name (e.g. B3GNT9_seqphase.inp and B3GNT9_seqphase.const for locus B3GNT9).\nMove the inp file from SeqPHASE to the directory with PHASE 2.1.1 and cd to that directory in the terminal. The inp file is used to run the following PHASE 2.1.1 command in the terminal. For each locus &lt;numberseed&gt; should be replaced with an arbitrary number selected by the user and LOCUSNAME replaced with the designated name for that particular locus. Because each locus is relatively short chose the S option at the modeling flag (-M) as it assumes no within-locus recombination. Additional parameters are explained in the documentation for PHASE 2.1.1 available here.\n./PHASE -MS -d1 -S&lt;numberseed&gt; -p0.85 -q0.85 -x5 -X10 LOCUSNAME_seqphase.inp LOCUSNAME_seqphase.out 5000 2 500 \nFurther analysis will require fasta alignments for each locus where each diploid individual is associated with two sequences corresponding to each of the two phased alleles determined in PHASE 2.1.1. Return to the online SeqPHASE tool and click the link to ‘step 2’. Select the appropriate out file generated by the PHASE 2.1.1 run along with the matching const file generated from step 1 in the SeqPHASE tool. The ‘Sort sequence’ box should be checked but the ‘Reduce sequences’ box should not be checked. Click the ‘Run SeqPHASE’ button and SeqPHASE will return a fasta file with the complete sequence alignment and two phased haplotypes designated by the project number for that individual sample followed by a and b respectively. Click the ‘Click here to download the generated Fasta file’ link at the bottom of the page and rename the file to match the locus name. Including the const file and unchecking the ‘Reduced sequences’ box will ensure the resulting fasta file includes the full length of the alignment, not just the variable sites.\nThe phasing procedure was repeated for the following nuDNA fasta alignments.\n\nB3GNT9.fasta\nBIRC2.fasta\nCCDC.fasta\nGPRC6.fasta\nLACTBL.fasta\nUSP38.fasta\n\nSubsequent analysis requires the following phased nuDNA alignments from the procedure described above.\n\nCOI.fasta\nND2.fasta\nB3GNT9_phased.fasta\nBIRC2_phased.fasta\nCCDC_phased.fasta\nGPRC6_phased.fasta\nLACTBL_phased.fasta\nUSP38_phased.fasta"

To reduce the amount of clutter on the maps subspecies were clustered together in shared geographic groups. Zosterops japonicus subspecies were designated as either Z. japonicus alani for the most remote subspecies in the Volcano Islands or grouped within a single Z. japonicus designation for all the remaining subspecies. Subspecies for Z. montanus were clustered into three groups including a Palawan group (montanus PALAWAN) consisting of Z. montanus parkesi, a northern Philippine group (montanus NORTH) for those subspecies on Mindoro and Luzon (Z. montanus halconensis amd Z. montanus whiteheadi), and a southern Philippine group (montanus SOUTH) including the remaining Z. montanus subspecies included in the study (Z. montanus diuatae, Z. montanus montanus, Z. montanus pectoralis, Z. montanus vulcani, and an unnamed but suggested subspecies on Panay). Subspecies within the Z. everetti and Z. nigrorum species were lumped together under a single species designation for each in the sampling maps but distinguished in later analyses. Samples from introduced populations in Hawaii and California are included in this list, but they are excluded from the final figure. The individual samples and their accompanying data from the file ZosteropsPOPS4_LatLong.txt are listed below.

Include two lines with the geo_point command. One line will define those points from the SNP sampling data frame (sampling.df) and identify those points as filled circles (pch=21). The next line will define the points using the geo_point command for the additional Sanger sequencing samples (samplingSANGER.df) and identify those points as triangles (pch=24). Because many of the sampling locations are the same for different taxa define position = position_jitter(h=0.5, w=0.5) to offset the points on the map so as they do not perfectly overlap. Also set alpha=0.5 to make the points transparent.

The sequence file is in phylip format.\nTo illustrate the data format an excerpt of the sequence file ZosteropsBPP_JMMSseq.txt is shown below (ellipsis indicates where additional sequences from the original file have been left out). One alignment of individual sequences follows the other sequentially in a single file. A space followed by two numbers indicate the beginning of a locus. First is the number of individual sequences for that locus. Remember that for those loci from phased nuclear coding DNA (nuDNA) there will be two sequences for each individual with the individual identifying code followed by a and b to denote the two phased alleles (see Sanger sequencing summary statistics and trees section). The following number is the length of the sequence alignment in base pairs (bp). Each sequence will lead with the sample, an a for the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) loci or either a or b for the phased cdDNA loci, and underscore, the locus name (e.g. COI, ND2, B3GNT9), a ^ symbol, and finally the individual sample name (minus the allelic designations, a and/or b). The individual sample name following the ^ symbol should match the individual names used to map taxon names (i.e. the imap file).\n 117 646\n\nZJal002a_COI^ZJal002

Below is the ctl file for the first A series BPP run (A1). Several parameters on the control (ctl) files are edited to execute different runs including the \\(β_θ\\) and \\(β_τ\\) parameters for the inverse 𝛤 prior distribution, and the species delimitation model (0 or 1). The \\(β_θ\\) and \\(β_τ\\) parameters for the inverse 𝛤 prior distribution are edited at the thetaprior and tauprior lines, each of which is specified by two digits for 𝛼 and 𝛽, but only the 𝛽 value will be changed across runs. A list of the ctl files and the key parameters for each A series run are shown in the BPP A10 runs table in the A10 results section below.

For the B runs the \\(β_θ\\) and \\(β_τ\\) parameters for the inverse 𝛤 prior distribution are 0.001 and 0.004 respectively. For the C runs the \\(β_θ\\) and \\(β_τ\\) parameters are 0.002 and 0.004, for the D runs these values are 0.001 and 0.0005, and for the E runs these values are 0.002 and 0.0005. Running BPP independently for different, but reasonable, distributions of 𝜃 and 𝜏 is used to assess the sensitivity of our estimates to the priors. Note that for all the A00 runs (run series B-E) the speciesdelimitation selections are omitted by being preceded by an asterisk, as is the speciesmodelprior selection. Three replicate runs are done for each combination of 𝜃 and 𝜏 priors and each species tree (TIP, MID1, MID2, and ROOT, see above). Starting each ctl file with seed = -1 creates a different random number seed for each replicate run. Independent runs for each species tree will be used to estimate 𝜃 and 𝜏 which will in turn be used to estimate the GDI for each branch (see description of GDI below).

This analysis seeks to describe general metrics of diversity and variation in East Asian Zosterops and makes some attempt to assess the utility of these data in clustering individuals by putative taxonomic and population groups.\n\n\n\nWe are using R version 4.4.2, RStudio version 2024.09.1 for the analysis. Quarto version 1.6.39 for Mac OS was used to document the workflow. Set the working directory in RStudio to one where the vcf.gz zipped data file and a txt file denoting the identity of the samples are accessible.\n\n\n\nThis analysis requires the following data files.\n\nzost.filtered.snps.vcf.gz The gzipped file containing the filtered SNP data in variant call format (VCF) (see DeRaad et al. 2024 for details on creation of the ddRAD library and filtering the SNP dataset) (DeRaad et al. 2024)\nZosteropsPOPS4.txt The text file containing the taxon and locale data for each individual sample in the SNP dataset.\n\n\n\n\nFor this run the taxon file we are using is ZosteropsPOPS4.txt containing the following samples. Samples of the migratory Zosterops erythropleurus are from breeding and non-breeding sites. Breeding sites for Z. erythropleurus are denoted RUSSIAb and non-breeding sites from Vietnam and denoted VIETNAMnb with b indicating breeding site samples and nb indicating non-breeding site samples.\nSAMPLE TAXON LOCALE \nZJlo012 japonicus KIKAI \nZJlo015 japonicus AMAMI \nZJlo016 japonicus MIYAKOJIMA \nZJlo017 japonicus IRIOMOTE \nZJlo021 japonicus TOKUNOSHIMA \nZJlo022 japonicus TOKUNOSHIMA \nZJlo024 japonicus YONAGUMI \nZJlo031 japonicus KUMEJIMA \nZJlo045 japonicus AMAMI \nZJlo046 japonicus MIYAKOJIMA \nZJlo050 japonicus OKINOERABU \nZJlo052 japonicus OKINOERABU \nZJlo055 japonicus KIKAI \nZJja001 japonicus GEOJE \nZJja002 japonicus GEOJE \nZJja003 japonicus JEJU \nZJja004 japonicus JEJU \nZJja005 japonicus JEJU \nZJja009 japonicus HEUKSANDO \nZJja010 japonicus HEUKSANDO \nZJja012 japonicus HONSHU \nZJja013 japonicus HONSHU \nZJja014 japonicus HONSHU \nZJja016 japonicus SHIKOKU \nZJja030 japonicus HEUKSANDO \nZJal003 japonicus_alani HAHAJIMA \nZjal004 japonicus_alani HAHAJIMA \nZJal005 japonicus_alani HAHAJIMA \nZJal010 japonicus_alani ANEJIMA \nZJal011 japonicus_alani ANEJIMA \nZJal012 japonicus_alani ANEJIMA \nZJal020 japonicus_alani IWOJIMA \nZJst007 japonicus KOZUSHIMA \nZJst009 japonicus KOZUSHIMA \nZJst010 japonicus KOZUSHIMA \nZJst012 japonicus MIYAKEJIMA \nZJst014 japonicus MIYAKEJIMA \nZJst015 japonicus MIYAKEJIMA \nZJin001 japonicus KAGOSHIMA \nZJin003 japonicus KAGOSHIMA \nZJsi002 simplex TAIWAN \nZJsi017 simplex GUANGXI \nZJsi032 simplex GUANGXI \nZJsi023 simplex GUANGDONG \nZJsi024 simplex GUANGDONG \nZJsi027 simplex GUANGXI \nZJsi028 simplex GUANGXI \nZJsi029 simplex GUANGXI \nZJsi031 simplex GUANGXI \nZPxx001 simplex SINGAPORE \nZPxx002 simplex SINGAPORE \nZMxx002 meyeni BATAN \nZMxx003 meyeni LANYU \nZMxx004 meyeni LANYU \nZMxx005 meyeni LANYU \nZMxx006 meyeni LANYU \nZMOxx001 montanus_SOUTH PANAY \nZMOxx002 montanus_SOUTH PANAY \nZMOxx003 montanus_SOUTH PANAY \nZMOxx005 montanus_SOUTH PANAY \nZMOha001 montanus_NORTH MINDORO \nZMOwh002 montanus_NORTH LUZON \nZMOwh003 montanus_NORTH LUZON \nZMOwh004 montanus_NORTH LUZON \nZMOwh005 montanus_NORTH LUZON \nZMOwh006 montanus_NORTH LUZON \nZMOvu002 montanus_SOUTH MINDANAO \nZMOvu003 montanus_SOUTH MINDANAO \nZMOvu004 montanus_SOUTH MINDANAO \nZMOvu005 montanus_SOUTH MINDANAO \nZMOmo001 montanus_SOUTH SULAWESI \nZMOpa001 montanus_PALAWAN PALAWAN \nZMOpa002 montanus_PALAWAN PALAWAN \nZNni001 nigrorum PANAY \nZERxx002 erythropleurus RUSSIAb \nZERxx004 erythropleurus RUSSIAb \nZERxx005 erythropleurus RUSSIAb \nZsim23588 simplex VIETNAM \nZsim28142 simplex VIETNAM \nZsim30897 palpebrosus VIETNAM \nZpal23498 palpebrosus VIETNAM \nZpal23522 palpebrosus VIETNAM \nZmon20893 montanus_SOUTH NEGROS\nZmon20892 montanus_SOUTH NEGROS \nZmon20902 montanus_SOUTH NEGROS \nZmon20909 montanus_SOUTH NEGROS \nZsim31166 montanus_SOUTH JAVA \nZsim31159 montanus_SOUTH JAVA \nZmey17876 meyeni BATAN \nZmey17877 meyeni BATAN \nZmey17852 meyeni BATAN \nZmey17922 meyeni SABTANG \nZmey17920 meyeni SABTANG \nZmey17925 meyeni SABTANG \nZmey17923 meyeni SABTANG \nZery28090 erythropleurus VIETNAMnb \nZery28091 erythropleurus VIETNAMnb \nZery28088 erythropleurus VIETNAMnb \nZni10863 nigrorum CAMIGUINNORTE \nZni14341 nigrorum CAMIGUINSUR \nZni19650 nigrorum LUZON \nZni17984 nigrorum LUZON \nZjaDOT-10981 palpebrosus VIETNAM \nZjaDOT-5235 simplex TAIWAN \nZ_LA_122866_2 simplex LOSANGELES \nZ_LA_122577_2 simplex LOSANGELES \nZ_LA_122188_2 simplex LOSANGELES \nZsim13809 simplex GUIZHOU \nZsim13773 simplex GUIZHOU \nZsim6797 simplex HUNAN \nZsim10336 simplex GUANGXI \nZsim11362 simplex GUIZHOU \nZsim11102 simplex GUIZHOU \nZsim11220 simplex GUIZHOU \nZmon20899 montanus_SOUTH NEGROS \nZmon28375 montanus_SOUTH MINDANAO \nZev13949 everetti CAMIGUINSUR \nZev31650 everetti SAMAR \nZev28451 everetti MINDANAO \nZ_HI_BRY431 japonicus HAWAII \nZ_HI_NAN290 japonicus HAWAII \nZ_HI_WAI087 japonicus HAWAII \nZ_HI_WAI078 japonicus HAWAII \nZ_HI_SOL783 japonicus HAWAII\n\n\n\nBegin the analysis by restarting the R session (Session/Restart R in RStudio), loading the initial package libraries, and starting a log of the analysis.

(UMAP) (“Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection” 2024) is a non-linear, stochastic algorithm to reduce dimensionality for visualization of multivariate data. UMAP seeks to preserve as much of the relationships among groups in the dataset as possible while reducing to a minimal number of components. In this case we are visualizing the SNP data with UMAP for two and three dimensions using the umap package and plotting the results for each analysis using the plot_ly command from the plotly package. The n_neighbors, min_dist, and metric arguments all reflect the default values. For each plot save as html files using the saveWidget command in the htmlwidgets package.\n\n# Set random seed\nUMAPseed = sample(1:999, 1)\nprint(UMAPseed)\n\n[1] 1\n\nset.seed(UMAPseed)\n\n# Define

among-group components in a way that maximizes discrimination among the groups (Thibaut Jombart, Devillard, and Balloux 2010). DAPC makes no explicit assumptions regarding recombination or panmixia. This allows use of the full SNP dataset without worrying about filtering to reduce the likelihood of linkage as is required for STRUCTURE or ADMIXTURE. A tutorial on DAPC is available here. First conduct a cross-validation analysis to help determine the optimal number of PCs to be retained in the DAPC. Test between 1 and 50 PCs (n.pca = 1:50) with 100 replicate runs per PC (n.rep = 100) of the cross-validation analysis. Use the multicore option and 6 CPUs (ncpus = 6L), or potentially more if your machine allows it. Even running multiple cores this run can take a while to execute. Executing this analysis within the system.time command will return an elapsed time for the operation.

The a-score is the difference between the proportion of successful reassignments using the real groups and assignments into randomly assigned groups. Thus the average a-score is the average percent improvement in discrimination over that based on random groupings. The code below will estimate the a-score across 30 replicate runs (n.sim = 30) and 40 PCs (n.pca = 40) showing the result per group for each run, the average across all replicates per group, and the overall average.\n\nZosteropsSNPsDAPC_OPTIMUM &lt;- dapc(gl.ZosteropsSNPs, n.pca = 40, n.da = nPop(gl.ZosteropsSNPs)-1)\na.score(ZosteropsSNPsDAPC_OPTIMUM, n.pca =

Three runs will be repeated for this analysis. One of those runs uses the optimal number of PCs from the prior iterated a-score estimations (the median optimal number of PCs across 100 replicate runs of the optimal a-score estimation). The other two runs of the DAPC analysis are four PCs less than the optimal and four PCs greater than the optimal number of PCs. Generate a scatter plot from the DAPC analysis and a bar plot showing the probability of assignment for each individual sample.

    "text": "Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) (“Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection” 2024) is a non-linear, stochastic algorithm to reduce dimensionality for visualization of multivariate data. UMAP seeks to preserve as much of the relationships among groups in the dataset as possible while reducing to a minimal number of components. In this case we are visualizing the SNP data with UMAP for two and three dimensions using the umap package and plotting the results for each analysis using the plot_ly command from the plotly package. The n_neighbors, min_dist, and metric arguments all reflect the default values. For each plot save as html files using the saveWidget command in the htmlwidgets package.\n\n# Set random seed\nUMAPseed = sample(1:999, 1)\nprint(UMAPseed)\n\n[1] 1\n\nset.seed(UMAPseed)\n\n# Define

    "text": "Discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) is a multivariate method that takes principal components (PCs) and partitions variance into within- and among-group components in a way that maximizes discrimination among the groups (Thibaut Jombart, Devillard, and Balloux 2010). DAPC makes no explicit assumptions regarding recombination or panmixia. This allows use of the full SNP dataset without worrying about filtering to reduce the likelihood of linkage as is required for STRUCTURE or ADMIXTURE. A tutorial on DAPC is available here. First conduct a cross-validation analysis to help determine the optimal number of PCs to be retained in the DAPC. Test between 1 and 50 PCs (n.pca = 1:50) with 100 replicate runs per PC (n.rep = 100) of the cross-validation analysis. Use the multicore option and 6 CPUs (ncpus = 6L), or potentially more if your machine allows it. Even running multiple cores this run can take a while to execute. Executing this analysis within the system.time command will return an elapsed time for the operation. This will return a graph showing the proportion of successful group predictions on the y-axis and the results from the individual replicate runs for each PC on the x-axis.\n\nDAPCseed = sample(1:999, 1)\nprint(DAPCseed)\n\n[1] 836\n\nset.seed(DAPCseed)\nsystem.time (ZosteropsSNPsDAPCpramx &lt;- xvalDapc(tab(gl.ZosteropsSNPs, NA.method = \"mean\"), pop(gl.ZosteropsSNPs), n.pca = 1:50, n.rep = 100, parallel = \"multicore\", ncpus = 6L))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    user   system  elapsed \n1686.290  271.423  361.423 \n\n\n\n\n\nThe DAPC cross validation provides some clues as to where we no longer need to add PCs to the DAPC to get increased discrimination, but we want to know exactly how many PCs is optimum for discrimination. The a-score is the difference between the proportion of successful reassignments using the real groups and assignments into randomly assigned groups. Thus the average a-score is the average percent improvement in discrimination over that based on random groupings. The code below will estimate the a-score across 30 replicate runs (n.sim = 30) and 40 PCs (n.pca = 40) showing the result per group for each run, the average across all replicates per group, and the overall average.\n\nZosteropsSNPsDAPC_OPTIMUM &lt;- dapc(gl.ZosteropsSNPs, n.pca = 40, n.da = nPop(gl.ZosteropsSNPs)-1)\na.score(ZosteropsSNPsDAPC_OPTIMUM, n.pca =

Three runs will be repeated for this analysis. One of those runs uses the optimal number of PCs from the prior iterated a-score estimations (the median optimal number of PCs across 100 replicate runs of the optimal a-score estimation). The other two runs of the DAPC analysis are four PCs less than the optimal and four PCs greater than the optimal number of PCs. Generate a scatter plot from the DAPC analysis and a bar plot showing the probability of assignment for each individual sample. Save both the scatter plot and bar graphs as pdf files and generate a tab-delimited table of the results for each individual sample with the columns being the original assigned population, the sample, the population assigned by the DAPC, and the posterior probability of that particular assignment. In addition, for each replicate run generate a loading plot displaying how each SNP contributes to the PCs for the optimal number of PCs and four less than and four greater than the optimal number.

A second taxon assignment file was created assigning individual samples to mostly species designation or more broad allopatric groups within species. That file is titled ZosteropsSPECIES.txt.

The filtered SNP data are in variant call format (VCF) (see DeRaad et al. 2024 for details on creation of the ddRAD library, sequencing, and filtering the SNP dataset) (DeRaad et al. 2024).\n\n\nSoftware\n\nvcf2phylip - Python script to convert a vcf file to a phy or nexus formatted file (Ortiz 2019).\nPAUP*4.0 - Phylogenetic Analyses Using Parsimony (PAUP) (Wilgenbusch and Swofford 2003).\nSVDQuartets - Singular Value Decomposition Quartets (SVDQuartets), implemented in PAUP*4.0 (Chifman and Kubatko 2014).\nPICL - Phylogenetic Inference with Composite Likelihood (PICL) (Kubatko et al. 2025; Swofford and Kubatko 2023).\nFigTree - Software for editing and visualizing trees.\nDelineate - Species delimitation using the multipopulation or multispecies coalescent and explicit models of speciation from a tree with branch lengths (Sukumaran, Holder, and Knowles 2021).\n\n\n\nR packages\n\nape - For visualizing and manipulating trees (Paradis and Schliep 2019).\ndplyr - For manipulating data (Wickham et al. 2023).\ngt - For creating tables and figures (Iannone et al. 2024).\ntidyr - For manipulating data (Wickham, Vaughan, and Girlich 2024).\nwebshot2 - For creating images to export for tables (Chang 2025).\n\n\n\nData files\nFor use in PAUP*, the vcf file containing the SNP data must first be converted into nexus format. The Python script vcf2phylip.py (Ortiz 2019) is used for this conversion. Make sure that Python version 3 is installed before running this script. Execute the following command in the terminal in a directory containing the file zost.filtered.snps.vcf. The -i argument identifies the input file and -n specifies conversion to nexus format.\npython3 vcf2phylip.py -i zost.filtered.snps.vcf -n \nBy default vcf2phylip.py requires at least four samples to be present at any given locus and adds min4 to the file name. This setting can be changed with the -m argument but the default value is four. The newly created nexus file will now be called zost.filtered.snps.min4.nexus. Many of the sample names have dashes (-) and underscores(_) and these characters create problems in PAUP* and other software packages. Remove these characters from the file with the following commands executed in the terminal.\nsed ’s/_//g’ zost.filtered.snps.min4.nexus &gt; zost.filtered.snps.min4edited.nexus\nsed ’s/-//g’ zost.filtered.snps.min4edited.nexus &gt; zost.filtered.snps.min4edited2.nexus\nThe final file used in subsequent SVDQuartets analyses will be zost.filtered.snps.min4edited2.nexus.\nFor later analyses using Phylogenetic Inference with Composite Likelihood (PICL) a SNP file in phylip (phy) format will be needed. This conversion of the vcf file to a phy file can be performed by changing the -n argument in vcf2phylip.py to -p, or alternatively you may omit the last argument altogether as vcf2phylip.py converts a vcf file to phy format by default.\npython3 vcf2phylip.py -i zost.filtered.snps.vcf\nThe converted phy file can then be cleaned of any _ and - in the individual sample names by executing the sed ’s/_//g’ and sed ’s/-//g’ commands in the terminal as described above for the nexus file.\nsed ’s/_//g’ zost.filtered.snps.min4.phy &gt; zost.filtered.snps.min4edited.phy\nsed ’s/-//g’ zost.filtered.snps.min4edited.phy &gt; zost.filtered.snps.min4edited2.phy\nIn some formats gaps are designated by -, but do not worry you are eliminating gaps from the data when editing the .nex and .phy files. Gaps are not coded with - in vcf files and will appear in the converted phy and nexus files as N along with any other missing data. The lesson here is to not include these characters in sample names to begin with!\nThe new phy formatted file will be zost.filtered.snps.min4edited2.phy but the file name will have to be changed later for the PICL analysis (see below).\nA taxon file will also be needed to match samples with specific taxa and populations. The taxon file we will use first is ZosteropsTaxa_POPS.nexus. This file identifies individual samples according to taxon and geographic population in order of the sample’s appearance in the zost.filtered.snps.min4.nexus file.\nbegin sets;\n    taxpartition ZosteropsTaxa =\n        japonicus_loochooensis_KIKAI : 1 13,\n        japonicus_loochooensis_AMAMI : 2 9,\n        japonicus_loochooensis_MIYAKOJIMA : 3 10,\n        japonicus_loochooensis_IRIOMOTE : 4,\n        japonicus_loochooensis_TOKUNOSHIMA : 5 6,\n        japonicus_loochooensis_YONAGUNI : 7,\n        japonicus_loochooensis_KUMEJIMA : 8,\n        japonicus_loochooensis_OKINOERABU : 11 12,\n        japonicus_japonicus_GEOJE : 14 15,\n        japonicus_japonicus_JEJU : 16-18,\n        japonicus_japonicus_HEUKSANDO : 19 20 25,\n        japonicus_japonicus_HONSHU : 21-23,\n        japonicus_japonicus_SHIKOKU : 24,\n        japonicus_alani_HAHAJIMA : 26-28,\n        japonicus_alani_ANEJIMA : 29-31,\n        japonicus_alani_IWOJIMA : 32,\n        japonicus_stejnegeri_KOZUSHIMA : 33-35,\n        japonicus_stejnegeri_MIYAKEJIMA : 36-38,\n        japonicus_insularis_KAGOSHIMA: 39-40,\n        japonicus_HAWAII : 120-124,\n        simplex_TAIWAN : 41 104,\n        simplex_GUANGXI : 42 43 46-49 111,\n        simplex_GUANGDONG : 44 45,\n        simplex_GUIZHOU : 108 109 112-114,\n        simplex_HUNAN : 110,\n        simplex_VIETNAM : 78 79,\n        simplex_SINGAPORE : 50 51,\n        simplex_LOSANGELES : 105-107, \n        palpebrosus_VIETNAM : 80-82 103,\n        meyeni_BATAN : 52 89-91,\n        meyeni_SABTANG : 92-95,\n        meyeni_LANYU : 53-56,\n        montanus_PANAY : 57-60,\n        montanus_halconensis_MINDORO : 61,\n        montanus_whiteheadi_LUZON : 62-66,\n        montanus_vulcani_MINDANAO : 67-70,\n        montanus_montanus_SULAWESI : 71, \n        montanus_montanus_JAVA : 87 88,\n        montanus_parkesi_PALAWAN : 72 73,\n        montanus_pectoralis_NEGROS : 83-86 115,\n        montanus_diuatae_MINDANAO : 116,\n        everetti_basilanicus_CAMIGUINSUR : 117,\n        everetti_basilanicus_MINDANAO : 119,\n        everetti_boholensis_SAMAR : 118,\n        nigrorum_nigrorum_PANAY : 74,\n        nigrorum_meyleri_CAMIGUINNORTE : 99,\n        nigrorum_catarmanensis_CAMIGUINSUR : 100,\n        nigrorum_innominatus_LUZON : 101,\n        nigrorum_luzonicus_LUZON : 102,\n        erythropleurus_RUSSIA_b : 75-77, \n        erythropleurus_VIETNAM_nb : 96-98;\nend;"

In the nexus taxon file we named the taxon partitions ZosteropsTaxa. Use this for the taxpartition designation in the svdq command line. We will evaluate all quartets (evalquartets=all), produce 700 bootstrap replicates (bootstrap nreps=700), and provide a name for the resulting tree file (treefile=ZosteropsPOPS_SVDQ.tre). 700 bootstrap replicates takes a very long time even on an M2 max MacbookPro with 96Gb RAM and is probably more than is needed. 200-300 replicates would likely perform just as well. But, we had time so we just waited for the biggest bootstrap procedure we could reasonably afford to do. The SVDQuartets analysis of these data was executed with the following command.\nsvdq taxpartition=ZosteropsTaxa evalquartets=all bootstrap nreps=700 treefile=ZosteropsPOPS_SVDQ.tre;\nThe following

    "text": "PICL\nHere we will use the software package Phylogenetic Inference with Composite Likelihood (PICL, pronounced “pickle”) to generate a species tree with branch lengths from the SNP data using the starting tree topology from SVDQuartets (Kubatko et al. 2025). Additionally, PICL will generate confidence intervals for the speciation times using bootstraps to estimate the reliability of each split on the tree.\n\nRun 1\nEach run of PICL requires the following three files in a directory with a copy of the executable picl program. Create a directory titled PICL/Zosterops1 with a copy of the executable picl program and copies of these files, remember that the file names must be the same as listed below.\n\ndata.phy - The SNP data in phylip format.\ntreefile.tre - A treefile in Newick format obtained from a collapsed version of the consensus tree in SVDQuartets (see above). Branch support values are removed and dummy initial branch lengths are added (see below).\nsettings - A settings file with the run settings and a taxon map assigning individual samples to taxa matching those in the treefile.tre.\n\n\nTaxa and starting tree\nFor the first PICL analysis we took the topology from SVDQ and collapsed populations into putative taxa and labeled those taxa as follows with abbreviated taxon names as follows.\n\nZosterops japonicus\n\njaponicus - All Z. japonicus subspecies and populations other than Z. japonicus alani in the Ogasawara and Volcano Islands. This taxon includes individual samples from the Korean Peninsula and adjacent islands of the East China Sea and Korean Strait, the main islands of the Japanese archipelago, the Ryukyu Islands, the Izu Islands, and the introduced population in the Hawaiian archipelago.\nalani - Populations of the Z. japonicus alani subspecies in the Ogasawara (Chichijima, Hahajima, Anejima, and Imotojima islands) and Volcano islands (Iwojima).\n\nZosterops meyeni\n\nmeyeni - Lanyu island off the east coast fo Taiwan and the Batan Islands of the Philippines including Batan and Sabtang islands.\n\nZosterops montanus\n\nnorth - Z. montanus from the Northern Philippine islands of Luzon and Mindoro.\nsouth - Z. montanus from the Visayas in the central Philippines including the main islands of Negros, Panay, Cebu, Bohol, Leyte, and Samar and subspecies/populations from the southern most islands of the Philippines including the island of Mindanao. Included with the central and southern Philippine Z. montanus samples is a Z. nigrorum sample (Zni14341). This sample originating from the island of Camiguin Sur off the northern coast of Mindanao was initially assigned to the Z. nigrorum subspecies catarmanensis but in this study was found to cluster strongly with the central and southern Philippine populations of Z. montanus in both Sanger sequencing and SNP datasets.\npalawan - Philippine Z. montanus parkesi population on the island of Palawan.\nindonesia - Z. montanus montanus populations of the Indonesian archipelago represented in this study by samples from Java and Sulawesi.\n\nZosterops simplex\n\nsimplex - All Z. simplex populations either from the island of Taiwan or on mainland continental Asia and introduced populations in the southern California region of North America.\n\nAdditional outgroup taxa\n\nerythro - Z. erythropleurus including samples originating in the breeding range in the Russian Far East and wintering individuals in Southeast Asia.\neveretti - Z. everetti in the Visayas and Southern Philippines.\nnigrorum - Z. nigrorum in the Visayas and Northern Philippines.\npalpebro - Z. palpebrosus samples from Vietnam.\n\n\nBecause run 1 is using a significantly collapsed tree with few taxa it can easily be entered in Newick format manually. Plot the final collapsed tree for PICL run 1 to see if it is correct. Manually save a copy of this as treefile.tre into the directory where PICL run 1 will be executed. The names of the files for a PICL run need to be specific. Dummy branch lengths will need to be added to this Newick formatted tree for PICL to have starting branch lengths to work from. Those branch lengths are arbitrary but made the final treefile.tre tree roughly clock-like and ultrametric. Below is the final starting tree for the PICL run 1 with the initial branch lengths and the final collapsed topology plotted using ape.\n((((((((japonicus:0.1,alani:0.1):0.1,meyeni:0.2):0.1,north:0.3):0.1,((indonesia:0.1,south:0.1):0.1,palawan:0.2):0.2):0.1,simplex:0.5):0.1,erythro:0.6):0.1,(everetti:0.4,nigrorum:0.4):0.3):0.1,palpebro:0.8);\n\nlibrary(ape)\n# Define the Newick string\ntopology &lt;- \"((((((((japonicus:0.1,alani:0.1):0.1,meyeni:0.2):0.1,north:0.3):0.1,((indonesia:0.1,south:0.1):0.1,palawan:0.2):0.2):0.1,simplex:0.5):0.1,erythro:0.6):0.1,(everetti:0.4,nigrorum:0.4):0.3):0.1,palpebro:0.8);\"\n# Read the tree from the Newick string\nPICL_topology1 &lt;- read.tree(text = topology)\nplot(PICL_topology1, edge.width = 4, label.offset = 0.02, cex = 1.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSettings\nThe PICL settings file is a text file that establishes the parameters for a particular run and matches individual samples to assigned groups. This file must be saved in the directory where PICL is to be run and named settings. Arguments for PICL are described in detail at https://github.com/lkubatko/PICL/blob/main/Documentation.md. The Model prompt specifies the type of data being utilized. 3 is entered for Model to indicate SNP data is being used. Theta is determined empirically for these data beforehand but any value that makes sense probably will do. Multiple runs with different entries for Theta would help the user assess the sensitivity of the analysis to this parameter. The Random_tree parameter set to 0 signifies that we are using a predefined tree included in the treefile.tre file (see above). Additionally, since a tree is provided for this analysis the Tree_search setting is also set to 0. The Num_opt setting should be a large number, 1,000,000 seems to work well for this dataset. Between runs the Seed1 and Seed2 settings should be set to any arbitrary number to set the random number seeds for the analysis. Following the last setting parameter (Verbose) should be a tally of all the taxa defined in the analysis, followed by the names of those taxa on the next line, and following that a list of the taxa and their associated samples separated by a space (the taxon name should come first). All these parameters should match. The individual sample names should match those in the nexus and phy files converted from the original vcf file. The taxon names associated with each sample should match the list of names directly above the sample list. Make sure the count of taxon names is correct and matches what appears in treefile.tre. It is wise to double (and triple) check these entries before starting a run. Additional details on the parameters in the settings file can be found in the PICL documentation.\nModel: 3\nGaps: 1\nBootstrap: 100\nTheta: 0.03501696\nRate_param: 1.0\nRandom_tree: 0\nOpt_bl: 1\nUser_bl: 0\nNum_opt: 1000000\nSeed1: 12345\nSeed2: 67890\nNum_cat: 4\nTree_search: 0\nNum_iter: 30000\nBeta: 0.005\nVerbose: 1\n12\njaponicus alani simplex palpebro meyeni indonesia south north palawan everetti nigrorum erythro\njaponicus ZJlo012\njaponicus ZJlo015\njaponicus ZJlo016\njaponicus ZJlo017\njaponicus ZJlo021\njaponicus ZJlo022\njaponicus ZJlo024\njaponicus ZJlo031\njaponicus ZJlo045\njaponicus ZJlo046\njaponicus ZJlo050\njaponicus ZJlo052\njaponicus ZJlo055\njaponicus ZJja001\njaponicus ZJja002\njaponicus ZJja003\njaponicus ZJja004\njaponicus ZJja005\njaponicus ZJja009\njaponicus ZJja010\njaponicus ZJja012\njaponicus ZJja013\njaponicus ZJja014\njaponicus ZJja016\njaponicus ZJja030\nalani ZJal003\nalani  Zjal004\nalani  ZJal005\nalani  ZJal010\nalani  ZJal011\nalani  ZJal012\nalani  ZJal020\njaponicus ZJst007\njaponicus ZJst009\njaponicus ZJst010\njaponicus ZJst012\njaponicus ZJst014\njaponicus ZJst015\njaponicus ZJin001\njaponicus ZJin003\nsimplex ZJsi002\nsimplex ZJsi017\nsimplex ZJsi032\nsimplex ZJsi023\nsimplex ZJsi024\nsimplex ZJsi027\nsimplex ZJsi028\nsimplex ZJsi029\nsimplex ZJsi031\nsimplex ZPxx001\nsimplex ZPxx002\nmeyeni ZMxx002\nmeyeni ZMxx003\nmeyeni ZMxx004\nmeyeni ZMxx005\nmeyeni ZMxx006\nsouth ZMOxx001\nsouth ZMOxx002\nsouth ZMOxx003\nsouth ZMOxx005\nnorth ZMOha001\nnorth ZMOwh002\nnorth ZMOwh003\nnorth ZMOwh004\nnorth ZMOwh005\nnorth ZMOwh006\nsouth ZMOvu002\nsouth ZMOvu003\nsouth ZMOvu004\nsouth ZMOvu005\nsouth ZMOmo001\npalawan ZMOpa001\npalawan ZMOpa002\nnigrorum ZNni001\nerythro ZERxx002\nerythro ZERxx004\nerythro ZERxx005\nsimplex Zsim23588\nsimplex Zsim28142\npalpebro Zsim30897\npalpebro Zpal23498\npalpebro Zpal23522\nsouth Zmon20893\nsouth Zmon20892\nsouth Zmon20902\nsouth Zmon20909\nindonesia Zsim31166\nindonesia Zsim31159\nmeyeni Zmey17876\nmeyeni Zmey17877\nmeyeni Zmey17852\nmeyeni Zmey17922\nmeyeni Zmey17920\nmeyeni Zmey17925\nmeyeni Zmey17923\nerythro Zery28090\nerythro Zery28091\nerythro Zery28088\nnigrorum Zni10863\nsouth Zni14341\nnigrorum Zni19650\nnigrorum Zni17984\npalpebro ZjaDOT10981\nsimplex ZjaDOT5235\nsimplex ZLA1228662\nsimplex ZLA1225772\nsimplex ZLA1221882\nsimplex Zsim13809\nsimplex Zsim13773\nsimplex Zsim6797\nsimplex Zsim10336\nsimplex Zsim11362\nsimplex Zsim11102\nsimplex Zsim11220\nsouth Zmon20899\nsouth Zmon28375\neveretti Zev13949\neveretti Zev31650\neveretti Zev28451\njaponicus ZHIBRY431\njaponicus ZHINAN290\njaponicus ZHIWAI087\njaponicus ZHIWAI078\njaponicus ZHISOL783\n\n\nRun\nTo run the analysis open a terminal session and cd to the PICL/Zosterops1 directory that was created earlier. Enter ./picl to run the program. Remember a copy of the picl executable file must be present in this directory along with the three needed data (data.phy) and settings files (settings and treefile.tre). After executing the ./picl command a summary of the settings should appear in the terminal followed by a list of the taxon designations and the number of individual samples in each. An alert will follow stating Estimation will be carried out using the SNP model followed by a summary of the data.phy file which should contain 124 lineages and 15704 sites. The tree will be read from the treefile.tre file and a summary showing the dummy branch lengths will follow. Once the tree is successfully read a composite likelihood for the initial tree will be calculated and a revised list of branch lengths and a new composite likelihood will follow. The program will state that the tree has been written to the file outtree.tre and the bootstrapping reps will follow. A running tally of the bootstrap reps will appear as each replicate bootstrap run is completed. 100 bootstrap replicates under these settings may take a while (up to several hours or more) depending on the size of the starting tree.\n\n\nResults\nThree files will be produced following a PICL run.The results file contains the branch lengths in the final estimated tree if Verbose is set to 1 (this is primarily used for debugging and simulation studies, and will not be useful for most users). The outtree.tre file should contain two trees in Newick format with branch lengths in mutation units (substitutions per site per generation) in the first tree and coalescent units (generations in units of twice the effective population size, 2Ne) for the second tree. The boot.dat file stores the results of the bootstrapping replicates. This file should have n-1 columns corresponding to the internal nodes of the tree where n equals the number of taxa designated in the settings file.\nNumbering the tips and internal nodes is a little tricky. Numbering begins consecutively with the tips and is followed by the numbers for the internal nodes. Because there are 12 taxa on this particular tree the internal nodes are numbered beginning at the root with 13.\nUsing the ape package in R read the outtree.tre upon completion of the PICL run and plot both the tree in mutation units and the tree in coalescent units. Add the correct node labels to the tree. You can make sure they make sense by matching up with the speciation time estimates from the bootstraps (see below).\n\n# Read the outtree file from PICL\nZosterops1_outtree &lt;- read.tree(\"Data/PICL/Zosterops1/outtree.tre\")\nnode_labels1 &lt;- c(13:23)\n\n# Plot the PICL outtree with the mutation units [1] and coalescent units [2]. \nplot(Zosterops1_outtree[[1]], edge.width = 3, label.offset = 0.001, cex = 1.2)\naxis(1, at = seq(0, max(Zosterops1_outtree[[1]]$edge.length), by = 0.05), labels = FALSE, tck = -0.02)\n  mtext(\"0.1 substitutions per site per generation\", side = 1, line = 2, at = max(Zosterops1_outtree[[1]]$edge.length) / 2.7)\n# Add labels to the internal nodes of the first tree with an offset\nn_internal_nodes1 &lt;- Nnode(Zosterops1_outtree[[1]])  # Number of internal nodes\nnodelabels(node_labels1[1:n_internal_nodes1], \n            node = (Ntip(Zosterops1_outtree[[1]]) + 1):(Ntip(Zosterops1_outtree[[1]]) + n_internal_nodes1), \n            frame = \"none\", cex = 0.8, adj = c(1.1, 1.2))  # Adjust adj for positioning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(Zosterops1_outtree[[2]], edge.width = 3, label.offset = 0.035, cex = 1.2)\naxis(1, at = seq(0, max(Zosterops1_outtree[[2]]$edge.length), by = 1.5), labels = FALSE, tck = -0.02)\n  mtext(\"3 coalescent units (2Ne)\", side = 1, line = 2, at = max(Zosterops1_outtree[[2]]$edge.length) / 2.7)\n# Add labels to the internal nodes of the second tree with an offset\nn_internal_nodes2 &lt;- Nnode(Zosterops1_outtree[[2]])  # Number of internal nodes\nnodelabels(node_labels1[1:n_internal_nodes2], \n            node = (Ntip(Zosterops1_outtree[[2]]) + 1):(Ntip(Zosterops1_outtree[[2]]) + n_internal_nodes2), \n            frame = \"none\", cex = 0.8, adj = c(1.1, 1.2))  # Adjust adj for positioning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally calculate the 95% confidence intervals for each node (speciation or split time) from the boot.dat file. Again, the boot.dat file should have no header and n-1 columns and 100 rows (or whatever value was set in the settings file at the Bootstrap prompt for the number of bootstrap replicates) of numerical estimates of speciation times measured in coalescent units. After calculating the means and 95% confidence interval for each column use the gt package to save the results to a table.\n\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:ape':\n\n    where\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(gt)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'gt'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:ape':\n\n    where\n\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(webshot2)\noptions(webshot2.chrome = \"/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome\")\n\n# Read the text file\nPICLbootstraps1 &lt;- read.table('Data/PICL/Zosterops1/boot.dat', header = FALSE)\n\n# Add a header line labeled 1-11\ncolnames(PICLbootstraps1) &lt;- as.character(13:23)\n\n# Initialize vectors to store means and confidence intervals\nmeans &lt;- numeric(ncol(PICLbootstraps1))\nlower_ci &lt;- numeric(ncol(PICLbootstraps1))\nupper_ci &lt;- numeric(ncol(PICLbootstraps1))\n\n# Calculate means and 95% confidence intervals for each column\nfor (i in 1:ncol(PICLbootstraps1)) {\n    # Remove NA values.

For run 2 the starting tree will include additional taxa based on the support values from the SVDQ 50% majority consensus tree. To make sure there are no mistakes in creating this tree, the workflow for carefully collapsing branches will be done using the ape package (see below).\nsettings - The settings file includes the same parameters as in run 1 except new random numbers are selected for the Seed1 and Seed2 settings and new taxon assignments for the individual samples are needed to match the new treefile.tre file.\n\n\nTaxa and starting tree\nFor the second PICL analysis we took the topology from SVDQuartets and collapsed populations where bootsrap support for a split was less than 60% (mostly, see below). We defined these lineages as putative taxa and labeled those taxa as follows with abbreviated taxon names as follows.\n\nZosterops japonicus\n\njaponicus - Within the subspecies/populations of Z. japonicus in the Ryukyus and the main islands of Japan and their nearby islands only the Z. japonicus stejnegeri populations on Kozushima and Miyakejima in the Izu Islands exhibited bootstrap support greater than 60%. Because these sister populations of Z. japonicus are deeply embedded in a grouping of very poorly supported lineages, all these continental island populations of Z. japonicus, along with those Izu Island populations of Z. japonicus, were collapsed into a single “continental” clade.\nalani1 - The far flung oceanic populations of Z. japonicus alani in the Ogasawara and Volcano Islands in the Pacific enjoy high support from all the “continental” populations of Z. japonicus in the Ryukyu Islands, Izu Islands, and the main islands of Japan (Honshu, Hokkaido, Shikoku, and Kyushu), and from one another in the SVDQuartets tree. The population of Z. japonicus alani on Hahajima is assigned the alani1 designation.\nalani2 - Z. japonicus alani from Anejima.\nalani3 - The most geographically isolated population of Z. japonicus alani from the Volcano Island of Iwojima (Iōtō).\n\nZosterops meyeni\n\nmeyeni1 - The northernmost population of Z. meyeni in this study collected on the island of Lanyu near Taiwan.\nmeyeni2 - Z. meyeni population on the island of Sabtang in the Batanes Islands in the Luzon Strait.\nmeyeni3 - Z meyeni population on the island of Batan in the Batanes Islands in the Luzon Strait.\n\nZosterops montanus\n\nmontanus1 - Z. montanus subspecies in the Northern Philippines including Z. montanus whiteheadi on the island of Luzon and Z. montanus halconensis on Mindoro.\nmontanus2 - Z. montanus on the island of Panay represents a hypothesized but as of yet unnamed subspecies.\nmontanus3 - Z. montanus pectoralis on the island of Negros in the Visayas in the Central Philippines.\nmontanus4 - Z. montanus vulcani in the southern part of the island of Mindanao.\nmontanus5 - Z. montanus diuatae in the northern and northeastern parts of Mindanao.\nmontanus6 - Z. montanus montanus on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.\nmontanus7- Z. montanus montanus on the Indonesian island of Java.\nmontanus8 - Z. montanus parkesi on the Philippine island of Palawan.\n\nZosterops simplex\n\nsimplex1 - Z. simplex from Singapore.\nsimplex2 - Z. simplex from the Chinese province of Guangxi.\nsimplex3 - A clade of poorly supported Z. simplex populations (all with &lt;40% support) including those from Vietnam, the island of Taiwan, the Chinese provinces of Guangdong, Guizhou and Hunan, and the introduced population in Los Angeles, California, USA.\n\nAdditional outgroup taxa\n\nerythro1 - Z. erythropleurus collected from the breeding range in the Russian Far East.\nerythro2 - Z. erythropleurus collected from the winter, non-breeding range in Vietnam.\neveretti1 - Z. everetti basilanicus from the island of Camiguin Sur off the north coast of Mindanao.\neveretti2 - Z. everetti basilanicus from the Philippine island of Mindanao.\neveretti3 - Z. everetti boholensis from Philippine island of Samar.\nnigrorum1 - Z. nigrorum nigrorum from the Philippine island of Panay.\nnigrorum2 - Z. nigrorum meyleri from the Philippine island of Camiguin Norte off the north coast of Luzon.\nnigrorum3 - Z. nigrorum innominatus from east-central Luzon.\nnigrorum4- Z. nigrorum luzonicus from the south-east Luzon.\nnigrorum5 - Z. nigrorum catarmanensis from the Philippine island of Camiguin Sur off the north coast of Mindanao. This taxon is represented by a single sample (Zni14341) that is consistently mismatched in every analysis with the Z. montanus clade instead of with Z. nigrorum, usually allied with those populations from either the central or southern Philippines.\npalpebro - Z. palpebrosus from Vietnam.\n\n\nBelow is the full Zosterops topology from SVDQuartets. The next steps may seem overly tedious but it is good to carefully ensure the right branches are being collapsed. What follows is a step wise procedure for achieving this using the ape package. Only branches with bootstrap values below 60% are being collapsed with two exceptions.\nThe Z. japonicus stejnegeri populations on the islands of Kozushima an Miyakejima are sister lineages with near 100% bootstrap support, but they are nested in a group of 15 other populations with extremely poor support. For this reason they were lumped into a single “continental” clade of Z. japonicus that includes all Z. japonicus populations except for the most far flung oceanic populations of Z. japonicus alani on the Ogasawara and Volcano Islands.\nAlso, Z. nigrorum catarmanensis from the Philippine island of Camiguin Sur is strongly nested within a clade of Z. montanus from the central and southern Philippines. Within this clade however it is positioned with poor support (48%) with a branch containing Z. montanus pectoralis from Negros and an unnamed population of Z. montanus from Panay. Because of this unexpected mismatch we kept Z. nigrorum catarmanensis as distinct in the taxon assignments from populations of Z. montanus.\n\nPICL_topology2 &lt;- read.tree(\"Data/SVDQ/ZosteropsPOPS_SVDQtopology.tre\")\nplot(PICL_topology2, label.offset = 0.1, cex = 0.7)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the root of the tree collapse nodes with relatively poor support (&lt;60, with exceptions noted above) starting with the Zosterops japonicus clade. Do this by removing all but one taxon for the group to be collapsed and then rename the remaining group with the name assigned to the collapsed group, japonicus.\n\n# Starting from the root of the tree collapse all the nodes with branch support &lt;60 starting with the japonicus clade. Include the well supported (99.57) split between the Z. japonicus stejnegeri populations on Miyakejima and Kozushima. This is the only well supported split in the entire continental japonicus clade.

Dummy branch lengths are added manually to this Newick formatted file for PICL to have starting branch lengths to work from.

Enter ./picl to run the program. Remember a copy of the picl executable file must be present in this directory along with the needed data (data.phy) and settings files (settings and treefile.tre). After executing the ./picl command a summary of the settings should appear in the terminal followed by a list of the taxon designations and the number of individual samples in each. An alert will follow stating Estimation will be carried out using the SNP model followed by a summary of the data.phy file which should contain 124 lineages and 15704 sites. The tree will be read from the treefile.tre file and a summary showing the dummy branch lengths will follow. Once the tree is successfully read a composite likelihood for the initial tree will be calculated and a revised list of branch lengths and a new composite likelihood will follow. The program will state that the tree has been written to the file outtree.tre and the bootstrapping reps will follow. A running tally of the bootstrap reps will appear as each replicate bootstrap run is completed. 100 bootstrap replicates under these settings takes maybe 15 hours or so on an M2 max MacBook Pro with 96Gb RAM with this particular starting tree.\n\n\nResults\nThree files will be produced following a PICL run.The results file contains the branch lengths in the final estimated tree if Verbose is set to 1 (this is primarily used for debugging and simulation studies, and will not be useful for most users). The outtree.tre file should contain two trees in Newick format with branch lengths in mutation units (substitutions per site per generation) in the first tree and coalescent units (generations in units of twice the effective population size, 2Ne) for the second tree. The boot.dat file stores the results of the bootstrapping replicates. This file should have n-1 columns corresponding to the internal nodes of the tree where n equals the number of taxa designated in the settings file.\nNumbering the tips and internal nodes is a little tricky. Numbering begins consecutively with the tips and is followed by the numbers for the internal nodes. Because there are 29 taxa on this particular tree the internal nodes are numbered beginning at the root with 30.\nUsing the ape package in R read the outtree.tre upon completion of the PICL run and plot both the tree in mutation units and the tree in coalescent units. Add the correct node labels to the tree. You can make sure they make sense by making sure they match up with the speciation time estimates from the bootstraps (see below).\n\n# Read the outtree file from PICL\nZosterops2_outtree &lt;- read.tree(\"Data/PICL/Zosterops2/outtree.tre\")\nnode_labels2 &lt;- c(30:57)\n\n# Plot the PICL outtree with the mutation units [1] and coalescent units [2]. \nplot(Zosterops2_outtree[[1]], edge.width = 3, label.offset = 0.001, cex = 1.2)\naxis(1, at = seq(0, max(Zosterops2_outtree[[1]]$edge.length), by = 0.1), labels = FALSE, tck = -0.02)\n  mtext(\"0.1 substitutions per site per generation\", side = 1, line = 2, at = max(Zosterops1_outtree[[1]]$edge.length) / 2.5, cex = 2)\n# Add labels to the internal nodes of the first tree with an offset\nn_internal_nodes1 &lt;- Nnode(Zosterops2_outtree[[1]])  # Number of internal nodes\nnodelabels(node_labels2[1:n_internal_nodes1], \n            node = (Ntip(Zosterops2_outtree[[1]]) + 1):(Ntip(Zosterops2_outtree[[1]]) + n_internal_nodes1), \n            frame = \"none\", cex = 1.5, adj = c(1.1, 1.2))  # Adjust adj for positioning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(Zosterops2_outtree[[2]], edge.width = 3, label.offset = 0.035, cex = 1.2)\naxis(1, at = seq(0, max(Zosterops2_outtree[[2]]$edge.length), by = 3), labels = FALSE, tck = -0.02)\n  mtext(\"3 coalescent units (2Ne)\", side = 1, line = 2, at = max(Zosterops1_outtree[[2]]$edge.length) / 3.3, cex = 2)\n# Add labels to the internal nodes of the first tree with an offset\nn_internal_nodes2 &lt;- Nnode(Zosterops2_outtree[[2]])  # Number of internal nodes\nnodelabels(node_labels2[1:n_internal_nodes2], \n            node = (Ntip(Zosterops2_outtree[[2]]) + 1):(Ntip(Zosterops2_outtree[[2]]) + n_internal_nodes2), \n            frame = \"none\", cex = 1.5, adj = c(1.1, 1.2))  # Adjust adj for positioning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Print existing tip labels to see the order, enter the actual scientific names in the right order, replace the tip labels with the scientific names\nprint(Zosterops2_outtree[[2]]$tip.label)\n\n [1] \"palpebro\"  \"montanus1\" \"japonicus\" \"alani3\"    \"alani1\"    \"alani2\"   \n [7] \"meyeni1\"   \"meyeni2\"   \"meyeni3\"   \"montanus8\" \"nigrorum5\" \"montanus2\"\n[13] \"montanus3\" \"montanus4\" \"montanus5\" \"montanus6\" \"montanus7\" \"simplex1\" \n[19] \"simplex2\"  \"simplex3\"  \"erythro1\"  \"erythro2\"  \"everetti1\" \"everetti2\"\n[25] \"everetti3\" \"nigrorum1\" \"nigrorum4\" \"nigrorum2\" \"nigrorum3\"\n\n# Choose the new names. \nZosterops2_outtree_species &lt;- c(\"Z. palpebrosus\", \"Z. montanus NORTH\", \"Z. japonicus CONTINENTAL\", \"Z. japonicus alani IWOJIMA\", \"Z. japonicus alani HAHAJIMA\", \n                                \"Z. japonicus alani ANEJIMA\", \"Z. meyeni LANYU\", \"Z. meyeni SABTANG\", \"Z. meyeni BATAN\", \"Z. montanus parkesi\", \"Z. nigrorum catarmanensis\",\n                                \"Z. montanus PANAY\", \"Z. montanus pectoralis\", \"Z. montanus vulcani\", \"Z. montanus diuatae\", \"Z. montanus montanus SULAWESI\", \n                                \"Z. montanus montanus JAVA\", \"Z. simplex SINGAPORE\", \"Z. simplex GUANGXI\", \"Z. simplex CHINA, TAIWAN, VIETNAM, USA\", \"Z. erythropleurus RUSSIA\", \n                                \"Z. erythropleurus VIETNAM\", \"Z. everetti basilanicus CAMIGUINSUR\", \"Z. everetti basilanicus MINDANAO\", \"Z. everetti boholensis SAMAR\", \"Z. nigrorum nigrorum\", \n                                \"Z. nigrorum luzonicus\", \"Z. nigrorum meyleri\", \"Z. nigrorum innominatus\")\nZosterops2_outtree[[2]]$tip.label &lt;- Zosterops2_outtree_species  \n\n# Plot the PICL outtree with the coalescent units, this will be used later to create a figure\nplot(Zosterops2_outtree[[2]], edge.width = 3, label.offset = 0.08, cex = 1.2, direction = \"upwards\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Remove the branch lengths and plot just the topology, this will be used later to create a figure\nZosterops2_outtree_topology &lt;- Zosterops2_outtree[[2]]\nZosterops2_outtree_topology$edge.length &lt;- NULL\nplot(Zosterops2_outtree_topology, edge.width = 3, label.offset = 0.3, cex = 1.2, direction = \"downwards\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalculate the 95% confidence intervals for each node (speciation or split time) from the boot.dat file.

    "text": "Delineate\nNow we have a well supported tree with branch lengths and at least some known, undisputed species we can use the python3 program Delineate (Sukumaran, Holder, and Knowles 2021) to test hypotheses regarding species limits. Delineate estimates speciation rates and rates of lineage birth from a tree where some lineages belong to known species and have been constrained as such while other lineages on the tree are unconstrained and therefore may be assigned to an existing species or delineated as a new species. Five runs are done with Delineate using the tree created in PICL and five different sets of lineage constraints.\n\nRun 1\n\nConstraints\nDelineate needs two files to run. They can be named whatever you wish. The first is a tree file. For this use the final tree produced from PICL run 2 with the branch lengths in coalescent units and exported to a nexus formatted file using Figtree (see above). Because the branch lengths are in coalescent units the speciation completion rates from Delineate will also be in these units. Some of the branch lengths are zero or very near zero with 95% CIs that include zero. Where there was a zero or near zero branch length on the tree the number of significant digits was changed to nine and a final estimated branch length of 1.0 x 10-9 was used instead.

This is done with a tab delimited text file with three columns and the column headers ‘lineage’, ‘species’, and ‘status’. The entries in the ‘lineage’ column should correspond to the lineages on the tree. ‘Species’ should reflect the species assignment for that particular lineage. ‘Status’ should indicate that this assignment is constrained (1) or unconstrained (0). In this first run all the lineages Z. japonicus, Z. japonicus alani, Z. meyeni, Z. montanus lineages were set as unconstrained. Z. nigrorum nigrorum (nigrorum1) and Z. nigrorum catarmanensis (nigrorum5) were also set as unconstrained due to their relatively long branches or taxonomic mismatch, respectively. The name for this assignment file for the first Delineate run is ZosteropsDELINEATE1_assignments.tsv.\nlineage species status\njaponicus   japonicus   0\nalani1  alani   0\nalani2  alani   0\nalani3  alani   0\nmeyeni1 meyeni  0\nmeyeni2 meyeni  0\nmeyeni3 meyeni  0\nmontanus1   montanus    0\nmontanus2   montanus    0\nmontanus3   montanus    0\nmontanus4   montanus    0\nmontanus5   montanus    0\nmontanus6   montanus    0\nmontanus7   montanus    0\nmontanus8   montanus    0\nsimplex1    simplex 1\nsimplex2    simplex 1\nsimplex3    simplex 1\nerythro1    erythropleurus  1\nerythro2    erythropleurus  1\neveretti1   everetti    1\neveretti2   everetti    1\neveretti3   everetti    1\nnigrorum1   nigrorum    0\nnigrorum2   nigrorum    1\nnigrorum3   nigrorum    1\nnigrorum4   nigrorum    1\nnigrorum5   nigrorum    0\npalpebro    palpebrosus 1\n\n\nRun\nThe authors of Delineate recommend running in a dedicated environment with the program and its dependencies installed. So that is what we did. Create a dedicated environment for Delineate using Anaconda. The authors of Delineate link to instructions for creating environments in their documentation. Once you have created an environment to run Delineate install the program and its dependencies within this environment. Again see the Delineate documentation for installation instructions. In the Anaconda Navigator app navigate to the Environments tab and choose the play button next to the DELINEATE environment (this is the obvious name we chose for our dedicated Delineate environment) and then from the dropdown menu select Open Terminal. You now should have a prompt in the terminal that looks like this.\n(DELINEATE) &lt;specific-user-name&gt;-mac Delineate %\nGo to the directory created for the Delineate runs containing the assignments (ZosteropsDELINEATE1_assignments.tsv) and the nexus formatted tree (ZosteropsPICL_tree.nex) with the cd command. To run an analysis that will estimate the partitions among the lineages enter the following command. The -t argument specifies the tree file and the -c argument identifies the assignment file used to define the constraints based on known species lineages. The default using delineate-estimate is to estimate all possible partitions and their probabilities. When there are relatively few constraints on the tree, this is an enormous number that will consume a commensurate enormous amount of computing resources and create huge data files for even a moderate number of lineages. The vast majority of these partitions will be associated with infinitesimally small probabilities. The -P argument restricts the report to the partitions that contribute most of the cumulative probability. -P 0.95 will cause Delineate to report only the partitions that contribute to 95% of the cumulative probability. The -u argument allows Delineate to better handle the numerical computing challenges when dealing with very small partition probabilities. This option is recommended for larger datasets with fewer a priori constraints. A full list of options and operations in Delineate is available in their documentation.\ndelineate-estimate partitions -t ZosteropsPICL_tree.nex -c ZosteropsDELINEATE1_assignments.tsv -P 0.95 -u\n\n\nResults\nThe fewer constraints in the assignments file the more possible partitions Delineate has to explore and the longer it will take. Three files will be created upon completion of a run.\n\nZosteropsDELINEATE1_assignments.delimitation-results.json\nZosteropsDELINEATE1_assignments.delimitation-results.trees\nZosteropsDELINEATE1_assignments.delimitation-results.trunc.trees\n\nNotice that each file begins with the name given to the .tsv assignment file. The .json file shows the results in a format that may be accessed in a browser or as a text document. The results in the .json file begin with a summary of the taxa, the tree used, estimates of the birth rate of lineages, the speciation rate, and a list of the constrained (known) and unconstrained

Compare the genetic distances with those from the morphometric dataset using Spearman’s ⍴. Because different groupings were used in the genetic versus morphometric PCAs in some cases we are using the mean genetic distance. For example, in the genetic PCA Z. montanus was divided into north, south, and Palawan groups. Here we are taking the mean from the genetic distances between those groups and using that in pairwise comparisons of genetic distance between Z. montanus and other species. Below is the data manually entered into a comma delimited (csv) txt file (Zosterops_genetic_morpho_dist.csv) used in analyses of correlation between genetic and morphological pairwise distances.\npairwise_comp,genetic_dist,morpho_dist\nMONT_MEYE,1.60,1.36\nMONT_EVER,36.23,0.88\nMONT_NIGR,28.42,0.27\nMONT_ERYT,18.93,2.44\nMONT_JAPO,4.37,3.00\nMONT_SIMP,26.40,2.07\nMONT_PALP,35.81,2.60\nMEYE_EVER,37.13,1.04\nMEYE_NIGR,29.33,1.45\nMEYE_ERYT,20.43,3.29\nMEYE_JAPO,2.75,2.13\nMEYE_SIMP,27.33,3.22\nMEYE_PALP,37.22,3.81\nEVER_NIGR,7.82,0.76\nEVER_ERYT,28.28,2.52\nEVER_JAPO,38.43,2.87\nEVER_SIMP,37.80,2.43\nEVER_PALP,39.36,2.89\nNIGR_ERYT,21.81,2.23\nNIGR_JAPO,30.69,3.08\nNIGR_SIMP,32.50,1.90\nNIGR_PALP,35.39,2.41\nERYT_JAPO,22.96,3.99\nERYT_SIMP,25.85,0.93\nERYT_PALP,18.54,1.48\nJAPO_SIMP,29.36,4.18\nJAPO_PALP,39.66,5.02\nSIMP_PALP,39.09,0.94\nCorrelation analysis using Spearman’s ⍴ between pairwise comparisons for genetic and morphological distance was calculated as follows.
